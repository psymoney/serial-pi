# Serial Pi
this is an experimental repository to test performances of blocking I/O and non-blocking I/O based serial communication on python/raspberry-pi.


## To-do
- [ ] create blocking I/O based serial communication protocol
- [ ] create non-blocking I/O based serial communication protocol
- [ ] create test environment, mocking serial ports
- [ ] dockerize entire project for easier reproduce
- [ ] make more complicate test cases with multiple serial communications
- [ ] replace python serial library with faster language one(e.g Rust)
